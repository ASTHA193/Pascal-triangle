# Pascal-triangle
A different approach for the pascal triangle pattern problem
## Introduction
All values outside the triangle are considered zero (0). The first row is 0 1 0 whereas only 1 acquire a space in pascal's triangle, 0s are invisible. Second row is acquired by adding (0+1) and (1+0). The output is sandwiched between two zeroes. The process continues till the required level is achieved. <br/>
Pascal's triangle can be derived using binomial theorem. We can use combinations and factorials to achieve this. <br/>

## Algorithm 
Assuming that we're well aware of factorials, we shall look into the core concept of drawing a pascal triangle in step-by-step fashion âˆ’

START
  Step  1 - Take number of rows to be printed, n.
  Step  2 - Make outer iteration I for n times to print rows
  Step  3 - Make inner iteration for J to (N - 1)
  Step  4 - Print single blank space " "
  Step  5 - Close inner loop
  Step  6 - Make inner iteration for J to I
  Step  7 - Print nCr of I and J
  Step  8 - Close inner loop
  Step  9 - Print NEWLINE character after each inner iteration
  Step 10 - Return
STOP
