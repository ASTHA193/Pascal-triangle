# Pascal-triangle
A different approach for the pascal triangle pattern problem
## Introduction
All values outside the triangle are considered zero (0). The first row is 0 1 0 whereas only 1 acquire a space in pascal's triangle, 0s are invisible. Second row is acquired by adding (0+1) and (1+0). The output is sandwiched between two zeroes. The process continues till the required level is achieved.<br\>
Pascal's triangle can be derived using binomial theorem. We can use combinations and factorials to achieve this.<br\>
